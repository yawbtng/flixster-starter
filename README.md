### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I would say yes for the most part. I felt unprepared for having to make multiple different API calls and understanding how to pass multiple state values and props through a parent componenet to different child componenets

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I was able to finish all the core and stretch features. I think I would have liked to implement a cleaner UI for the modal and sidebar, along with better responsive design for smaller screen

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

At the very end of the video, the like and watched tabs did not work they way I intended. I utilized localStorage in the browser for this so for next steps I would check if the movie objexts are still in local storage. Next time I would to implement a smoother UI and a sidebar that can be opened and closed with an animation/button.
